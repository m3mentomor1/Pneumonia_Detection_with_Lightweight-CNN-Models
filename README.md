# Pneumonia Detection with Lightweight CNN Models

### üßê I. Overview
This repository contains a project focused on identifying the presence of pneumonia in chest X-ray images. Each image can be classified into one of three categories: **Bacterial Pneumonia**, **Viral Pneumonia**, or **Normal**.

This project leverages 3 models trained via transfer learning. These models are adapted from the following pre-trained lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to perform multiclass image classification:
- MobileNet-V2
- ShuffleNet-V2
- SqueezeNet 1.1

All models are trained using identical batch sizes, epochs, & data preprocessing techniques to ensure a fair comparison of their performance.

#### Chest X-Ray Images
- The dataset is re-structured into three main directories: **train**, **val**, & **test**. Within each directory, there are subfolders representing different image categories, namely **Bacterial Pneumonia**, **Viral Pneumonia**, & **Normal**. Altogether, the dataset comprises 4,353 chest X-ray images in JPEG format, distributed across the three classes in each set.
- These chest X-ray images were chosen from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients aged 1-5 years old at the Guangzhou Women and Children‚Äôs Medical Center, Guangzhou. The chest X-ray imaging was conducted as part of the routine clinical care for these patients.
