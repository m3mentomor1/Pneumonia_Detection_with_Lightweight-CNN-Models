  <h1>Pneumonia Detection with Lightweight CNN Models</h1>
</div>

### üßê I. Overview
This project evaluates the effectiveness of three lightweight CNN models in detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images, considering both performance & computational efficiency. The images are categorized into three classes: **Bacterial Pneumonia**, **Viral Pneumonia**, or **Normal**.

Each model employs a corresponding lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture fine-tuned through transfer learning to do multiclass image classification on a chest X-ray dataset:
- MobileNet-V2
- ShuffleNet-V2
- SqueezeNet

For a fair evaluation, all models have been trained using identical batch sizes, epochs, and data preprocessing techniques. Additionally, while the architectures of MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, and SqueezeNet vary in design principles and specific layers, the process of adapting them for chest X-ray image classification remains consistent across all three models. Specifically, only the final fully connected layer of each model is replaced to align with the number of classes in the dataset. This modification enables a fair comparison of the models' performances without further alteration to their respective architectures.

#### Chest X-Ray Images
- The dataset is re-structured into three main directories: **train**, **val**, & **test**. Within each directory, there are subfolders representing different image categories, namely **Bacterial Pneumonia**, **Viral Pneumonia**, & **Normal**. Altogether, the dataset comprises 4,353 chest X-ray images in JPEG format, distributed across the three classes in each set.
- These chest X-ray images were chosen from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients aged 1-5 years old at the Guangzhou Women and Children‚Äôs Medical Center, Guangzhou. The chest X-ray imaging was conducted as part of the routine clinical care for these patients.

### üßæ IV. Model Evaluation

#### **A. Test Accuracy**
| Model         | Accuracy (%) |
|---------------|--------------|
| MobileNetV2   | 90.08        |
| ShuffleNetV2  | 88.43        |
| SqueezeNet    | 56.61        |

MobileNetV2 demonstrated the highest accuracy, indicating its strong ability to generalize & perform well on new data beyond the training & validation sets. In contrast, SqueezeNet exhibited the lowest accuracy, indicating challenges in effectively generalizing to new instances.

#### **C. Confusion Matrix**

**"MobileNetV2"**

**"ShuffleNetV2"**

**"SqueezeNet"**

The values along the diagonal of each matrix indicate the number of correctly predicted images classified as normal, bacterial pneumonia, and viral pneumonia, representing the True Positives (TP). From the first figure, MobileNetV2 exhibited excellent performance by correctly predicting 167 out of 172 cases of Bacterial Pneumonia, 124 out of 148 cases for Viral Pneumonia, and 145 out of 164 cases for images without Pneumonia. In the second figure, ShuffleNetV2 predicted 163 out of 172 Bacterial Pneumonia cases, 124 out of 148 for Viral Pneumonia, and 141 out of 164 for images without Pneumonia. Finally, in the last figure, SqueezeNet's predictions show 60 out of 172 cases for Bacterial Pneumonia, 62 out of 148 for Viral Pneumonia, and 152 out of 164 for images without Pneumonia.

#### **D. Classification Report**

**"MobileNetV2"**
|                     | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Bacterial Pneumonia | 0.87      | 0.97   | 0.92     |
| Viral Pneumonia     | 0.97      | 0.88   | 0.93     |
| Normal              | 0.87      | 0.84   | 0.85     |

**"ShuffleNetV2"**
|                     | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Bacterial Pneumonia | 0.88      | 0.95   | 0.91     |
| Viral Pneumonia     | 0.97      | 0.86   | 0.91     |
| Normal              | 0.82      | 0.84   | 0.83     |

**"SqueezeNet"**
|                     | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |
|---------------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Bacterial Pneumonia | 0.82      | 0.35   | 0.49     |
| Viral Pneumonia     | 0.46      | 0.93   | 0.61     |
| Normal              | 0.79      | 0.42   | 0.55     |

MobileNetV2 demonstrates strong precision and recall scores across all categories, indicating balanced performance in correctly identifying positive cases (true positives) & effectively avoiding false positives & false negatives. ShuffleNetV2 also exhibits respectable precision & recall scores, particularly for the bacterial & viral pneumonia categories. However, SqueezeNet's classification report reveals lower precision & recall scores, especially for bacterial pneumonia, suggesting challenges in accurately identifying positive cases for this category.

#### **E. Computational Efficiency**
| Model         | Model Size (MB) | Average Inference Speed (ms/image) |
|---------------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| MobileNetV2   | 8.72             | 9.30                              |
| ShuffleNetV2  | 4.95             | 9.18                              |
| SqueezeNet    | 2.77             | 5.79                              |

MobileNetV2 strikes a balance between model size and inference speed. ShuffleNetV2, while smaller in size compared to MobileNetV2, exhibits a slightly faster average inference speed. On the other hand, SqueezeNet distinguishes itself with its compact model size and relatively faster average inference speed. While MobileNetV2 and ShuffleNetV2 offer a balance between model size and speed, SqueezeNet prioritizes compactness, resulting in faster inference speeds at the expense of some model complexity.

(*Note: The model sizes were extracted directly from the file sizes after training, while the average inference speed was computed by predicting 10 chest X-ray images from the test set and then averaging the time taken to predict a single image in milliseconds.*)
