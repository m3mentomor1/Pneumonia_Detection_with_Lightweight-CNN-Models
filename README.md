# Pneumonia Detection with Lightweight CNN Models

### üßê I. Overview
This repository contains a project focused on identifying the presence of pneumonia in chest X-ray images. Each image can be classified into one of three categories: **Bacterial Pneumonia**, **Viral Pneumonia**, or **Normal**.

This project leverages 5 models trained via transfer learning. These models are adapted from the following pre-trained lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to perform multiclass image classification:
- MobileNet-V2
- ShuffleNet-V2
- SqueezeNet 1.1
- ResNet-18
- EfficientNet-B0
